I've made several realizations in my use of Github--such are that Git and GitHub are essential tools for managing and collaborating on software projects. One on hand, Git helps track changes in
my code through version control, while on the other, GitHub provides an online platform where I can create repositories for my projects. By hosting my code on GitHub, I can easily share it with my team, 
work together on updates, review each otherâ€™s contributions, and manage different versions efficiently.
